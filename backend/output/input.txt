Good Evening Brian,

My name's Josh, and I've been engineering ML/AI platforms for north of 5 years now.

My current company is in the closing stages, and I'm looking for my next home as an engineer!

My newest project is HomeML, A sleek, locally-hosted AI chat interface with LAN discovery, private user profiles, and secure, on-device chat history.

I'm free most evenings after 4:30p.m. EST, I'd love to set up a time to meet and discuss my experience and how I could be a great fit!

Thanks,

Joshua
